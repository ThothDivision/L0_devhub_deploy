//! Connection-ESTABLISHMENT liveness for the hive-p2p endpoint: the inbound
//! budgets, the accept deadline's bookkeeping, and the counters that say
//! whether this endpoint can still form a NEW connection in either direction.
//!
//! The failure this exists for (fc-virginia 2026-09-12 and 09-18, fc-sanjose
//! 2026-09-24): iroh's layer above noq stops completing connection setup —
//! the last outbound trunk opens, `net_report` stops, and every inbound
//! connection that finishes its handshake then waits forever in iroh's
//! `register_connection`. Warm trunks keep serving, so every peer-count
//! signal stays up. The accept task used to hold its budget permit across
//! that unbounded await, so the budget filled with permits of connections
//! that no longer existed and the endpoint answered CONNECTION_REFUSED to
//! the whole fleet for hours (335,055 refusals on fc-sanjose in one day).
//! [`crate::serve_tunnels_full`] now bounds the accept, and everything it and
//! [`crate::PeerPool`] observe about establishment is recorded here, so the
//! wedge is a number ([`establish_stats`]) instead of a journal archaeology
//! session, and `hive-cloud`'s meshwatch can act on it.
//!
//! Counters are process-global like `VERIFY_STATS`/`PQ_KEX_STATS`: one
//! endpoint per process serves the fleet ALPN, and the stats must be
//! readable without threading a handle through every caller.
