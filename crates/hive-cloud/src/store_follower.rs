//! The follower pull: adopt the control-plane owner's `store_sync::REGISTRY`
//! stores on every other node. Two supervised loops, neither of which ever
//! touches GuardianDB or the relational SQL mirror — replication of canonical
//! state must never wait on either (it used to run inside
//! `spawn_relational_mirror_loop`, after `relational::sync_deployments`, whose
//! guardian SQL open has no bound):
//!
//! * `store-follower-sync` — every `HIVE_STORE_SYNC_SECS` (60), every small
//!   store fetched CONCURRENTLY from the owner (`HIVE_STORE_SYNC_CONCURRENCY`,
//!   8), then adopted one at a time.
//! * `store-large-lane` — LARGE stores (`store_sync::LARGE_STORE_BYTES`:
//!   billing, incidents, audit) one at a time, each under the budget its size
//!   calls for (`store_sync::fetch_budget`), in their own task so the small
//!   cadence never waits on a multi-minute transfer. At the ~170 KB/s one
//!   trunk sustains, billing (6.2 MB) and incidents (10.9 MB) could never
//!   finish in the batch's 10 s, and 8-way concurrency on the same trunk only
//!   split the bandwidth further.
//!
//! Lanes ([`StoreLanes`]): a store is in the large lane while its size — the
//! local copy or the last snapshot a peer served — is over the threshold
//! (pulled at most once per [`LARGE_STORE_PULL_EVERY`] after a success,
//! retried after [`LARGE_STORE_RETRY`] after a failure), or while it is
//! SUSPECT: its batch fetch ran out the whole budget while other stores on
//! the same trunk fetched, which is the one failure shape that says "too big
//! for the batch" before any size is known (a fresh follower's empty copy).
//! A suspect store is pulled every lane round until a pull succeeds and its
//! size decides. Any other failure stays in the batch and retries next tick;
//! a tick where every store failed is the link, and the lane holds off until
//! the batch sees the link again.
//!
//! Adoption rules (wholesale only from an owner every node agrees on, merge
//! stores from anyone) are unchanged; see the comment in [`pull_batch`].
