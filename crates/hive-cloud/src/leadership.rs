//! Leader-only BACKGROUND jobs: the one question every single-writer job asks.
//!
//! Each job used to carry its own leadership test — `is_control_plane_leader()`
//! here, `control_plane_leader() == node_name` there, a 2-tick window for the
//! billing meter, a raw `control_plane_owner(..)` with the DNS pin for DNS and
//! ACME — so they had different strengths, and the weakest one decided the
//! damage. On 2026-09-24 fc-virginia's per-observer view flapped to "I am the
//! owner" while fc-sanjose kept serving: its self-heal redeployed a live node's
//! projects 1512 times in 10 h, it took DNS leadership beside the real writer,
//! and it metered billing from a stale fork. [`may_act`] is now the ONLY gate
//! those jobs consult, and it is deliberately stricter than the request-path
//! test (`CloudState::is_control_plane_leader`, which only decides where a
//! mutation is served):
//!
//! * **owner** — this node is the job's designated owner. With
//!   `HIVE_CP_OWNER_CHAIN` set that is the STRICT chain owner
//!   (`Cluster::strict_chain_owner`: first chain entry present in the gossip-
//!   fresh set with an identity and a public address; the observer's own
//!   `healthy` flag is never consulted). No qualifying entry = no owner = HOLD
//!   everywhere; the identity election and the `HIVE_CP_LEADER` /
//!   `HIVE_DNS_LEADER_NODE` / `HIVE_BILLING_COORDINATOR_NODE` pins are ignored
//!   while a chain is set. Without a chain, a node with a mesh roster
//!   (`HIVE_EXPECTED_NODE_IDS`, else `HIVE_TRUSTED_NODE_IDS`) HOLDS with an
//!   ERROR — a curated fleet member missing its chain must never elect itself —
//!   and only a roster-less (dev) mesh keeps the pre-chain designations;
//! * **fresh view** — this node has completed at least one gossip round (a
//!   node with no roster has none to wait for). A booting backup's registry is
//!   empty, so before its first round it would name ITSELF the strict owner;
//! * **not isolated** — `mesh_health().isolated` is false;
//! * **voter majority, for a BACKUP owner only** — when this node owns without
//!   being the chain head (`chain[0]`), it must have fresh DIRECT contact
//!   ([`CloudState::direct_contact_ids`]: an outbound dial/trunk success or an
//!   inbound self-report, never relayed gossip) with a strict majority of
//!   `HIVE_CP_VOTERS` (identical fleet-wide, public servers, odd count),
//!   counting itself when it is one. The head acts on presence (design CS-1
//!   1b): a quorum on the head turned "present through relays but short of
//!   direct reach" into a writer nobody replaces — every other node still sees
//!   it present, so none of them owns. `HIVE_CP_VOTERS` unset while a chain is
//!   set logs an ERROR once and drops the quorum term entirely (voters derived
//!   per observer from differing chains are not a quorum);
//! * **tenure** — every precondition above has held CONTINUOUSLY for
//!   [`Job::min_tenure`] (sampled every 3 s by the cluster loop and on every
//!   call; any lapse — ownership, freshness, isolation, quorum — resets it). A
//!   returning or re-quorate owner waits its tenure again, which is the window
//!   in which a backup that acted in its absence sees it present and stops.
//!
//! Each continuous run of OWNERSHIP has a term id ([`Verdict::term`]). A lapse
//! of the other preconditions shorter than [`TERM_LAPSE`] keeps the term — no
//! other node can have taken over in that time — and a longer one starts a new
//! term when they hold again (a backup may have written meanwhile). Callers
//! that do take-over work on "I just became the writer" key it on the term,
//! never on an edge of [`may_act`]: a quorum or isolation blip is not a new
//! tenure.
//!
//! What this gate cannot do: move the writer away from an owner that is present
//! but cannot act (a backup short of a voter majority, an isolated head).
//! Every node still sees it as owner, so the jobs HOLD until it recovers or
//! disappears. Only the signed control-plane lease (CS-3) expires such an
//! owner. A future lease swaps in underneath [`may_act`] without any caller
//! changing. Two leader-coordinated surfaces deliberately do NOT use this gate
//! yet: the cron loop (fires every node's local jobs) and raw-port allocation
//! (request-path, leader-local `raw_ports.json`). Both need a replicated store
//! before a stricter gate can move their writer safely.
